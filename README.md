# Regression Analysis for Ticket Sales

This is a simple personal project practicing regression analysis on a publicly available dataset for movie ticket sales. All analysis was done using R. The dataset was found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himelsarder/cinema-hall-ticket-sales-and-customer-behavior

Here is a brief report on the methodology followed and conclusions:

### Goal
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate an ability to use basic R functions and syntax for data analysis, along with an understanding of statistical concepts for regression. Using a publicly available dataset, I sought to predict the "Purchase_Again" variable (i.e., did the customer return to purchase more tickets) based on a variety of numeric and categorical predictors. To keep this practice project simple, only the first 500 rows of data were used, and some categorical variables were reduced to binary indicators.

### Exploratory Analysis
After importing the data and converting columns to the appropriate data type, I began an exploratory analysis. This consisted of viewing summary statistics, such as the mean and variance for numeric variables and the level counts for categorical variables. Histograms were generated to view the distribution of numeric variables.  For categorical variables, bar graphs were created comparing the categorical variable to the response, Purchase_Again. When comparing categorical vairables to the response in this way, it seemed that the proportion of returning customers differed only slightly across levels; perhaps the relationship between some of these predictors and the response is quite weak.

A few graphics created in the exploratory analysis:

### Model Fitting
Following the data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I fit an intial regression model with all possible predictors. Since our independent variable, Purchase_Again, is a binary response, a logisic regression model is most appropriate. The p-values for all predictors was above the chosen significance level, α = 0.05, I concluded that none of the predictors had a statistically significant relationship with the response.
Multicollinearity, where several dependent variables are correlated and account for the same information, is oftentimes an issue in regression models. However, upon checking the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for our initial glm model, all predictors had a VIF=~1, meaning this was not significantly impacting the regression model.
From here, stepwise deletion seemed like a viable strategy, as some predictors had very small β slopes and p-values close to 1. The remaining predictor with the highest p-value was iteratively removed from the model, one at a time. Each time a new model was fit, an ANOVA test (using the Chi-Squared distribution) was performed to determine if the variance accounted for across the models significantly differed. In each case, as variables were eliminated, the p-values of the ANOVA test were higher than the selected significance level α; from this, we conclude that the models are comparable (i.e., the larger model is not significantly better than the smaller model at predicting the response). In this case, we should proceed with the smaller model.
As this stepwise deletion process was iteratively followed, the p-values for our predictors remained above the chosen significance level. Even after only one dependent variable remained (a binary indicator of seat type - Standard or VIP/Premium), this predictor was not significanly associated with the response (p-value=0.121).

### Conclusions
In this dataset, none of the provided variables have a statistically significant relationship with the response, Purchase_Again. Conclusions and next steps that can be drawn from this include:
* **Study New Variables:** The variables for which we collected data in this study are not significantly associated with the response. We collected data for the "wrong" predictors. If possible, we should collect additional on a new set of possible predictors, hoping to identify new variables that are significantly associated with our response. Some examples of variables that could be collected in customer surveys include: ticket purchase method, rather or not the cusomer received promotional material, does the individual typically access movies through at-home streaming services, and more.
* **Verify Data Origins:** Since this study used a publicly available dataset, I am unable to determine the methods used to collect this data, why these variables were measured, or the original purpose. These factors can be highly relevant in data analysis, so in practice, data collection methods should be properly verified.
* **Expand Statistical Methods:** This study was quick and simple, meant to practice some basic skills in R syntax and regression methodology. As such, some categorical variables were reduced to binary indicators and the exploratory analysis was limited. It is possible that some hidden variation or relationship was eliminated when reducing certain categorical variables. Spending more time with the data, running additional regression experiments, and developing a greater understanding of our collection of predictor variables could lead to more effective models.
* **Work With What We Have:** In some contexts, additional data collection or further modeling experiments can be costly and impractical. Even though our predictors do not have a statistically significant relationship with the response at our chosen α level, we can still gain some insights into the relationships through our β slopes.  For example, the regression coefficient of our Single_or_Group variable (where 0 = attended the movie alone, 1 = attended with a group) is negative; this tells us that, if a customer attended a movie with a group, they are less likely to return to purchase additional tickets. Dedicated moviegoers that are willing to watch films alone are more likely to return for the latest release. Likewise, the binary Seat_Type variable (where 0 = standard seating and 1 = VIP/Premium) was also negative, indicating that returning customers are usually satisfied with standard seating. Those hat pay for VIP seating may only visit the theater occasionally, and are less likely to return. If additional data collection or modeling is not possible, working with the current models could still generate business value for the Cinema in question.

Ultimately, although we were not able to identify statistically significant relationships between our Purchase_Again response and the available predictors, this analysis provided insight into the dataset and identified possible next steps in the procedure. With additional time and resources, a deeper dive into the factors impacting returning customers could lead to an improved model and greater insights.
