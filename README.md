# Regression-Analysis-for-Ticket-Sales

This is a simple personal project practicing regression analysis on a publicly available dataset for movie ticket sales. The dataset was found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himelsarder/cinema-hall-ticket-sales-and-customer-behavior

Here is a brief report on the methodology followed and conclusions:

# Goal
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate an ability to use basic R functions and syntax for data analysis, along with an understanding of basic statistical concepts for regression. Using a publicly available dataset, I sought to predict the "Purchase_Again" variable (i.e., did the customer return to purchase more tickets) based on a variety of numeric and categorical predictors. To keep this practice project simple, only the first 500 rows of data were used, and some categorical variables were reduced to binary indicators.

# Exploratory Analysis
After importing the data and converting columns to the appropriate data type, I began an exploratory analysis. This consisted of viewing summary statistics, such as the mean and variance for numeric variables and the level counts for categorical variables. Histograms were generated to view the distribution of numeric variables.  For categorical variables, bar graphs were created comparing the categorical variable to the response, Purchase_Again.
From this, I concluded that some slight variation was present in the proportion
